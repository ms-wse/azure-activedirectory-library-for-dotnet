# Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for .NET, Windows Store and Windows Phone 8.1

Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) provides easy to use authentication functionality for your .NET client and Windows Store apps by taking advantage of Windows Server Active Directory and Windows Azure Active Directory.
Here you can find the source code for the library. You can find the corresponding releases (both stable and prerelease) on the NuGet gallery at [http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/).

- The latest stable release is [2.10.10910.1511](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/). Note that this is for .NET only.

- There is no prerelease version available at this point.

## Samples and Documentation

[We provide a full suite of sample applications and documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADSamples) to help you get started with learning the Azure Identity system. This includes tutorials for native clients such as Windows, Windows Phone, iOS, OSX, Android, and Linux. We also provide full walkthroughs for authentication flows such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect, Graph API, and other awesome features. 

## Community Help and Support

We leverage [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to work with the community on supporting Azure Active Directory and its SDKs, including this one! We highly recommend you ask your questions on Stack Overflow (we're all on there!) Also browser existing issues to see if someone has had your question before. 

We recommend you use the "adal" tag so we can see it! Here is the latest Q&A on Stack Overflow for ADAL: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal)

## How to Run Tests

The majority of tests in this repo are mstests which run either as unit tests (with TestCategory 'AdalDotNetUnit' or 'AdalWinRTUnit') or as end to end test running against a mock service (with TestCategory 'AdalDotNetMock' or 'AdalWinRTMock'). 
These tests are self contained and can run either using Test Explorer in Visual Studio or command line tool mstest.exe.

To run the rest of the tests, you need to create an account on Azure Active Directory (AAD) and/or setup your own ADFS server and then configure them with configurations in file STS.cs.
